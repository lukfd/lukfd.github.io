                Impacts of seasonally frozen ground on streamflow recession in
                the Red River of the North Basin. Statistical analyses revealed
                that the antecedent winter soil temperature and snowpack control
                the seasonal dynamics of hydrograph recession.

                create a model to give content creators the ability to predict
                the rating of their app in the Google Play Store based on our
                variables.
