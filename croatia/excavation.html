          <h5>The Site:  Archaeological and Historical Context</h5>
          <p class="lead">
            This Roman villa site is located on the island of Sveti Klement (St. Clement), in the Bay of Soline, among a series of islands in the central Adriatic that were strategically and commercially important throughout antiquity.  The remains are located along the shore, on the edge of a fertile field still under cultivation.  Two ancient structures are still standing above ground and some parts of the villa complex are today submerged, as the sea level rose since antiquity.  The name of the bay – Soline – indicates the existence of Roman salt works, which were operational into the 16th century and have been confirmed by aerial imagery and underwater investigations. The economy of the villa would have been connected with the production of salt and/or garum (fish sauce) alongside other agricultural cash crops, notably wine and olive oil.

                    Sveti Klement Island, with its agricultural land, deep bays with good anchorage, and resources for salt production and stone quarrying, has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Late Bronze Age and Iron Age tombs were found in several locations, but no settlements of those periods are known so far. Two Roman-period sites have been documented in next to/near the island’s two fertile fields where settlement continues today. Greek pottery discovered in excavation indicates that the Soline site was part of the network known at the nearby islands of Vis and Hvar, which had colonies of Greek settlers from the early 4th century BCE.

          <h5>The Soline Project:  Approaches, Methods and Objectives</h5>
          <p class="lead">The centrality of the Adriatic Sea for travel and exchange between Mediterranean and European societies conditioned the life and economy of the islanders since antiquity. The ancient settlement in Soline bay is our focus of research and documentation, but knowledge of the landscape and seascape of St. Clement is essential for our understanding of the way of human life, human-environmental relationship, and of historical contacts and change. The long-term research objective of our project is to answer broad questions, including: How did the Greeks and Romans socialize the central Dalmatian seascape? What resources did they use and how did they design their settlements? How have human activities changed the island landscape through a long time period from antiquity to the present day?</p>

                    The archaeology of islands and coastal landscapes is an established methodological perspective, which calls for an interdisciplinary approach and for the application of modern archaeological methods and theories. Our project is interdisciplinary and international in scope.  Teams of professionals, students and volunteers from the disciplines of archaeology, architecture, art history, geography, geology and history have participated so far. In addition to the core of Croatian and American participants, Austrian, German and Spanish teams have conducted geophysical surveys and digital documentation of the site. Our project is contributing to the preservation of Croatian cultural and archaeological heritage as well as local community development. In 2008 the Croatian Ministry of Culture declared the site Protected Archaeological Heritage. This official status resulted from our cooperative Croatian-American archaeological research and documentation carried on in 2007 and 2008.

            The twelfth season of the international and interdisciplinary investigations of the Roman villa in Soline Bay on Sv. Klement Island took place from June 5-17, 2019. The excavation continued in the production area of the villa. Probe 21 was the western extension of Probe 20 from the previous year. What seemed to be the NW corner of the perimeter wall of the production area was found that year in Probe 20. Then it was also uncovered that the northern perimeter wall continues further east, where more basins may be found. The objective of extending the probe to the west in 2019 was to explore possible architecture west of the western perimeter wall and the layer that contained numerous coins and fresco fragments, reached at the very western edge of Probe 20.

              The expansion to the west showed that the northern perimeter wall continued westward, where the ancient salt works were located. The soil layer below the foundation of the northern wall that contained those rich finds last year, proved to be a layer of fill of discarded remains of building material (stone, roof tiles), decomposed mortar and fragments of painted wall plaster. Mixed in it were pottery sherds, mosaic tesserae, 52 late Roman bronze coins (4th-5th c.) and one bronze key of a type current in the Early Empire. The fill might have been deposited after some rebuilding or renovation in the 6th century or later. Study of the finds in the fill, especially coins, will clarify these changes. 

              University of St. Thomas Art History major, Madeline Olson, a recipient of a Young Scholar grant, conducted research in collaboration with Dr. Vanessa Rousseau on the use of pigments in wall paintings found in the villa excavations.

            The twelfth season of the international and interdisciplinary investigations of the Roman villa in Soline Bay on Sv. Klement Island took place from June 4-19, 2018. The excavation continued in the production area of the villa. Probe 20 was the northern extension of Probe 19 from the previous year, where we excavated two basins covered with fine waterproof mortar. The full extent of the shallow basin was uncovered in Probe 20 and another such but smaller shallow basin was found structurally connected to it on its eastern side. The investigations of this season confirmed that these basins were structurally and functionally connected with the production spaces and installations uncovered between 2014 and 2017. This complex consisted of three built components: 1) two shallow basins of different sizes and one deep basin, all covered with fine, waterproof lime mortar; 2) a round stone base for a press (wine or olive oil); 3) a square basin with the interior covered in waterproof mortar with crushed ceramic (opus signinum) and an imbedded stone bowl for settling impurities.

              Many fragments of small, ceramic floor tiles were found in soil layers. Those were set in a fish-bone pattern for floor covering and were another type of flooring common in agricultural production spaces that dealt with liquids. At least two phases of construction were documented in the production area. 
	The ceramic finds included small fragments of Hellenistic black glaze bowls, Italian terra sigillata bowls, late Roman African and Phocaean red slip tableware, Aegean and African kitchen ware and amphorae, from the Italic Republican Lamboglia 2 type to the late imperial 
North African and Aegean imports. There were also several fragments of ceramic beehives and many fragments of roof tiles.  In total, there were 3615 ceramic finds. As in all previous years, mosaic tesserae were found in large numbers, 1605 in total. The most significant finds were the 10 coins and 1225 fragments of wall paintings, many of them polychrome. The coins were late Roman, 4th-5th century. The best preserved was a coin of emperor Julian from the year 364.
	New this summer was the application of drone technology in recording the excavation process and relating features of human presence to the environment. The results were 3D models of the site and study maps of modeled contemporary and ancient landscapes. Two St. Thomas  students of geography, Alice Ready and Emma Rinn received summer research grants, Sustainability Scholar Grant and Young Scholar Grant respectively, to employ drone technology in archaeological and environmental study of the site. Emma sequentially recorded the excavation process and then analyzed the drone-acquired imagery and data in ESRI’s ArcGIS Pro/Scene software to create 3D models of the multi-period site. Alice used the drone to generate a study area of the villa site and acquired high-resolution georeferenced images. In collaboration with Dr. Paul Lorah (Geography) and through ArcPro OrthoMapping she processed an orthomosaic and digital elevation model depicting the landscape. By masking out vegetation and extracting edges of built features (indications of human presence), she demonstrated the effectiveness of drones in highlighting areas of potential archaeological significance in the landscape.

            The eleventh season of the international and interdisciplinary investigations of the Roman villa in Soline Bay on Sv. Klement near Hvar took place in June 2017.  The objective was to continue uncovering and connecting partially excavated, multi-phase spaces of the production area of the villa. A new Probe 19 was excavated in the extension of Probe 18 from 2016, which contained a round stone structure, most likely a base for a press, built on top of an earlier wall and a floor. We documented in Probe 19 that this round structure functionally connected to two basins, both covered with fine, waterproof mortar inside and over the edges. One basin was large and very shallow (0.10 m), while the other was small and deep (0.75 m). The large basin continued northward, outside the edge of the probe. The two basins might have belonged to an earlier phase and might have had even a different function (production of fine salt?).

              Contrary to no previous finds of architecture outside the western perimeter wall of the production area, we documented a new room with a waterproof floor (opus signinum) abutting on the west side of that wall and continuing outside the probe. More production spaces are evidently expected to the west and north. The ceramic finds included a fragment of a mold-made Italian terra sigillata bowl, decorated with garlands and a fragment of a Hellenistic black glaze bowl, in addition to late Roman African and Phocaean sigillata and Aegean and African kitchen ware. The amphora finds ranged from Lamboglia 2 type of the 1st c. BCE to the African and Aegean imports of the 4th-6th c. CE. There were also several fragments of ceramic beehives.  The most significant was the find of an almost complete fibula of Aucissa type, current from the late 1st c. BCE to mid 1st c. CE. There were no coins found this season. 

Probe 19 provided new evidence for the layout, chronology and architectural changes in late antiquity in the production complex of the villa. Overall, the fine and varied pottery imports, across a significant time span, speak about a successful and important estate and its economic and maritime role in the Mediterranean networks.

            The tenth season of the international and interdisciplinary investigations of the Roman villa in Soline Bay on Sv. Klement near Hvar took place in June 2016.  The objective was to continue uncovering and documenting architectural features in the production area of the villa. Two probes were excavated to the north and west of the standing wall B. Probe 17 had 9 stratigraphic units of soil layers and no architectural remains. It confirmed that there were no built spaces outside of the west perimeter wall documented in the previous seasons. Probe 18 contained another segment of this west perimeter wall, which still continued north, outside the probe.

              Other architectural remains in Probe 18 confirmed at least two building phases and showed that production spaces extended further to the north and east. A round structure built of rough-cut stone set in thick lime mortar (diameter 2 m) could have been a base of some agricultural feature, most likely a press for making wine or olive oil. It was adjacent to and probably functionally connected with the basin with the floor in waterproof mortar (opus signinum) and an imbedded stone bowl for settling impurities, uncovered in 2015 (Probe 16). Under the round structure was a floor made of fine mortar with sand and small stones, which belonged to an earlier building phase. The floor was associated with an E-W wall, onto which the round structure was built.  
A large number of white limestone tesserae of various sizes were found in both probes, but only one fresco fragment. Earlier residential spaces were perhaps repurposed for production functions. The ceramic finds included very few fragments of Hellenistic and early imperial ware in addition to late Roman African and Phocaean sigillata, Aegean and African kitchen ware and amphorae. There were also several fragments of ceramic beehives.  The most significant find was an almost complete amphora in situ by the eastern face of the western perimeter wall. Among the metal finds, there were 3 late Roman bronze coins and one small bronze plate, perhaps part of a belt buckle. The architectural structures related to agricultural production and the ceramic beehives indicated beekeeping and honey production.  Imported fine and utilitarian wares showed the economic, navigational and strategic role of this villa in the Mediterranean exchange.

            In the ninth season of the collaborative investigations we continued excavating in the production area of the villa, and expanded and connected some previously excavated trenches. Probes 15 and 16 uncovered segments of the architectural features previously documented in Probes 2, 9, 11 and 14, which were excavated in 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. The middle section of an E-W wall, found in Probes 2 and 9 that abutted wall B, was confirmed in Probe 15. This wall ended in the joint with the N-S wall uncovered already in Probe 14. Only the foundations of these walls were found at 0.60 m (2 Roman feet) wide and constructed of roughly cut stones, set in lime mortar. These walls seemed to be the west and south perimeter walls of the production area. A layer of collapsed wall and roof material with evidence of burning was documented north of the E-W wall. It contained numerous fragments of wall plaster, some with polychrome painting in red, yellow and black.

              One roof tile fragment had a PANSI[ANA] stamp of the Augustan period. In Probe16, the extension of Probe 11 from 2013, we completely documented a basin (1.30 x 1.80 m) with a floor of waterproof mortar (opus signinum), sloping down to a central, round depression, which ended in an imbedded stone bowl (D=32.5 cm) at its bottom. The walls of the basin were built of irregular ashlars in lime mortar and varied in width from 0.50-0.60 m. This may have been a cistern or a basin for olive oil sedimentation. The mixed layers above the collapse in Probe 15 and those above the basin in Probe 16 contained large amounts of predominantly white mosaic tesserae. The finds of table and utilitarian pottery from those layers were dated from the late Hellenistic to the late Roman period. The wide chronological span of the finds in those soil layers was due to the modern agricultural activities, which disturbed the soil deposits through time.

Two University of St. Thomas students, Andrew Ring and Caitlin Woodard, received Young Scholar summer grants. Andrew, a history major, researched ancient and modern wine making, based on ancient literary sources and on archaeological evidence for production, storage and transport of wine. Caitlin, a geography/environmental studies major and history minor, researched the relationship between the environment and human activities on Sveti Klement Island. She focused on settlements and land use from ancient to modern times.

            In the eighth season of the joint Croatian-American interdisciplinary investigations the objective was to continue the excavation of the production area of the villa. Probe 14 (extension of Probe 11 from 2013) extended over roughly 14 square meters and contained another segment of the N-S wall uncovered in 2013, which extended further north, outside the probe. A poorly preserved mortar floor was found along its eastern side. The wall was 0.60 m (2 Roman feet) wide and built of fairly regular stone ashlars, set in mortar. The mortar floor had a subfloor of rough stones in thick mortar. Numerous fragments of wall plaster, some with traces of polychrome paint (red, yellow, black), were found in the layer above the mortar floor, together with stones from a collapsed wall and ceramic roof tiles.

              A very large number of white limestone mosaic tesserae of various sizes (86% large, rectangular) were found in the six soil layers above the collapsed building material and the floor. The ceramic finds included one fragment of a Hellenistic fish plate and sherds of late Roman African and Phocaean fine wares, Aegean and African kitchen ware and amphorae. There were also numerous sherds of large storage jars (dolia) and several fragments of ceramic beehives.  There were fragments of Roman glass and one small tessera of blue glass paste. Among the metal finds, there were 6 late Roman coins and one Venetian coin (1691), all found in mixed levels. The most significant was a complete but broken bronze pitcher, found in situ along the western face of the N-S wall. The discovery of polychrome frescoes and fine mosaic tesserae indicate some residential spaces, which may be from an earlier, probably early imperial, building phase. We have the evidence for extensive spaces of the production and storage area in the villa as well as rebuilding and re-purposing of spaces in late antiquity.

            The joint Croatian-American-Austrian investigations continued excavating in the target areas of the 2012 season. Three probes were excavated to the bedrock. In Probe 11 (extension of 8 from 2012) segments of three intersecting walls (N-S/E-W), built of roughly cut stones set in mortar and preserved a little above their foundations, enclosed three spaces, which extended beyond the probe. A floor of waterproof mortar (opus signinum) was documented in the space in the NE corner of the probe. It had a round central depression (D=50 cm), which sloped down to an imbedded stone bowl (D=32.5 cm) at its bottom. The floor in opus signinum was comparable to such features found in previous years in this area (Probes 4 and 8) and indicated the location of a production sector. Most importantly, we found the evidence of an earlier building phase in Probe 11.

              The N-S wall found along the entire western edge of the probe was set over the stone foundation of an earlier wall of the same direction, but running at a slight angle eastward. Fragments of wall plaster, some with traces of polychrome paint, were found in the clayish layer above the bedrock in the southern half of the probe.  Probe 12 (extension of 10 from 2012) had two intersecting walls (N-S/E-W).  The E-W wall was set at a slight angle over the N-S wall, already documented in Probe 10. Many fragments of charred roof tiles (tegulae and imbrices) were found in the eastern half of this probe, collapsed over a burned floor. One tegula fragment had a complete PANSIANA stamp of the Augustan period, probably reused in the later (late antique?) construction.  Small fragments of late Hellenistic and early Roman fine wares were found in the layer below the burned floor. Several layers in Probes 11 and 12 yielded a total of 26 bronze coins, most seemingly late Roman by their size. This is significant, considering that only three Roman bronze coins (2nd and 4th c. and an illegible late Roman) were found in all earlier campaigns. Probe 13 was excavated at the south end of the standing wall B in order to determine its continuation. The wall terminated at this point in an L-shaped structure, which, as wall B, rested on a layer of mortar, spread over the bedrock. It looked as a gateway.

            In the sixth campaign of the Soline Project, we continued international collaboration in the interdisciplinary exploration of the Soline site and of the island as a whole in its geographical, historical and environmental context. We resumed small-scale excavation based on the results of the test trenches in 2011 and of the magnetometric surveys in 2010 and 2007.  The objective continued to be documenting the layout of the villa and the chronology of building and settlement. Additionally, a small-scale field survey in the vicinity of the villa and underwater survey in Soline Bay provided valuable data. Dr. Tina Neuhauser from the University of Graz led the Austrian collaborative team of her students for the second season. Beside participating in the excavation, the Austrian team conducted digital documentation of the strata and of features and special finds uncovered in the test trenches using a total station.

              We excavated four probes: Probe 7, dimensions 3 x 4 m, was the extension to the north of Probe 6 from 2011, located between the wall B and the shore. The objective was to follow two layers of mortar floors uncovered in 2011 and to define the space (room?), which was indicated by magnetometry in 2010. The two floors and their respective sub-floors were found preserved in large patches. The upper mortar floor had two layers of sub-floors beneath: a first layer of small stones in lime mortar, and a second layer of large stones mixed with lime mortar. The lower floor was finer and smoother, with a sub-floor of small, horizontally laid stones in lime mortar. The lower floor was related to the remains of a wall, which ran perpendicular to wall B and was detected by magnetometry in 2010. This floor therefore belonged to the late antique phase of the villa.  The upper floor must be connected with a yet undated, post-Roman re-flooring of the space. Probe 8 was the extension of Probe 4 from 2011, located at the north end of wall B. The objective was to completely uncover the feature (floor?) made of Roman waterproof mortar (with crushed brick), which appeared in 2011 connected to the N-S wall, and to define their spatial relationship. The waterproof mortar feature was completely uncovered, but its function and the entire space remain unclear. Further extension of this probe will be necessary. Probes 9 and 10 were expansions of the trenches excavated in the 1950s. The area between the trenches contained some discarded pottery and roof tiles from the old excavations. Two fragmentary, stamped tiles of the north Italian factory PANSIANA were found. The factory was active in the 1st c. CE and its tiles have been common finds in the entire Adriatic region. The tiles most likely belonged to the first villa built in Soline Bay. In Probe 9 patches of white mosaic were found in situ. The mosaic was connected with the N-S wall, which had traces of red wall painting preserved in that section. In the east section of the E-W wall a well-preserved Roman coin was found. By its size and the images on the averse and reverse, it could date from the period of the Antonines in the 2nd c. CE. A floor made of terracotta tiles was uncovered in Probe 10. Fragments of the Hellenistic relief pottey of the 1st century BCE were found in the fill below the mortar subfloor.
A small-scale walking survey in the surrounding area using GPS to document the location of human activity on the island focused on the hill to the southeast of the villa site. The commanding view of the sea on each side of the island and the fields below made this location interesting for possible connection with the villa. St. Thomas geography major Nick Yannarelly conducted the survey and recorded the data. A mound of stones located on the north slope of the hill could have been a prehistoric, Illyrian grave. Another St. Thomas student, Caitlin Steele, was a recipient of a Young Scholar grant for her research of comparing the environmental causes of the abandonment of the Soline salt works and the abandonment of Ostia, the port city of Rome.
Three archaeologists from the University of Zadar, Croatia, conducted underwater survey in Soline Bay. There were four diving locations: 1) Shallow inner bay, walls of salt works; pottery finds and a stone fill outside the salt works; 2) Area along Rt Kovač surveyed from 25-40 m depth; amphorae 2nd c. BCE-6th c. CE; 3) Area of Prevojice Bay, down to 35 m (no visible artifacts, possibly under sediment); 4) West side of Dobri Island, single dive, no archaeological material.

            In the fifth campaign of the Soline Project from June 14-30, we continued our interdisciplinary exploration and international collaboration of documenting the topography of the site and the chronology of building and settlement. An Austrian team led by Dr. Tina Neuhauser, Karl-Franzes University, Graz, with her two students, Florian Dinius and Silvia Zenz, collaborated on the project and undertook digital survey of all visible architectural features (standing and uncovered in test probes) with a Total Station. Dr. Branimir Šegvić, a geologist at the University of Darmstadt, Germany, conducted a geological survey and collected samples of clay, soil and stone at the site and at selected locations on the island (quarry in Taršće Bay, lime kiln in Soline Bay). He also took samples of lime mortar from the standing and excavated walls and floors.

              We opened three test probes. Their locations were based on the data obtained by the magnetometric survey in 2010. The objective was to document and clarify spatial and stratigraphic relationships between different periods of construction in three targeted areas. Probe 4 was an expansion of Probe 2 from 2010, where we attempted to uncover the intersection of the north-south wall of the late Roman phase with the presumably underlying northwest-southeast wall of an earlier phase. We found the continuation of the N-S wall and a segment of a thick floor made of Roman waterproof mortar attached to it. An 18 cm-long section of a lead pipe was found inserted in the base under the floor. There was no evidence of an earlier wall. Probe 5 was an expansion of Probe 3 from 2010, located east of wall B, at a point where the 2010 magnetometry indicated a corner of an earlier architectural complex. No architectural remains were found in this probe. The bedrock that is close to the surface may cause false magnetometric readings interpreted as walls. Probe 6 was set up to the west of wall B, where the magnetometry indicated a north-south wall parallel with wall B (c. 12.5 m apart) and several rooms lined up along that wall. We attempted to uncover one of those rooms. The east half of the probe yielded a floor made of chipped stone in lime mortar of an undetermined, post-Roman date. The floor was removed after it was documented and photographed. The soil fill below it contained small pottery fragments dating from the Hellenistic to the early modern period. Below the fill deposit were the foundations of an E-W wall and related to it was a lime mortar floor with upward risen edges. The feature looked like a very shallow basin. The magnetometry reading was successful in this case.
A St. Thomas biology student, Channing James, conducted research on ancient and modern water use and storage. She took samples of cistern water in several locations in the village of Vlaka, and of the rainwater collected in a cave well, located on the rocky shoreline at Vodeni Rat (Water promontory), west of Soline Bay. The cave well was used from ancient until recent times (c. 1950’s). Grooves in the rock, made by ropes, are clearly visible. It is abandoned now and the rainwater is mixed with seawater due to the sea level rise. 
Marinko Petrić organized the first public presentation of the Soline site and its archaeological research from 2007 to 2011. It was held in the courtyard of the church of St. Mark in Hvar and was well attended by the locals and tourists.

            As in the previous campaigns, the fourth season of research during June of 2010 was limited to non-invasive methods and small, targeted test trenches. At the start, the tall grass had to be cut and several areas of the site, previously unexplored, were cleared of vegetation. Dr. Felix Teichner, archaeologist from the Goethe University in Frankfurt, and Dr. Jesus Ignacio Jimenez Chaparro, archaeologist from the University of Oviedo, Spain, surveyed the site using a Total Station. They set up a site grid and created a topographical plan of all visible architectural remains and test trenches. All the special data was geo-referenced to the topographical system of Croatia. They also conducted a magnetometric survey over the total area of 1050 square meters, including the area surveyed in 2007. The results confirmed the previous analysis and showed a complex layout of structures underground with evidence of multi-period occupation and at least two phases of building. The majority of the visible architecture, oriented in the north-south direction, belonged to late antiquity.  The magnetometry revealed another architectural complex, oriented NW-SE, which apparently ran diagonally under the standing «long wall» (wall B) and should belong to an earlier phase (the Early Empire?). There was another structure of a different orientation and close to the present shoreline.  The German Archaeological Institute supported the work of Drs. Teichner and Chaparro.

              The Croatian-American team opened two test trenches, Probes 2 and 3. The work in Probe 2 continued from 2009 and the two walls abutting wall B were excavated to their foundations on the bedrock. The probe yielded several fragments of late Hellenistic pottery and more were visible in the section of the fill under wall B. This pottery may be connected with the earlier building phase, if not with an episode preceding any building on the site. Probe 3 was located to the west side of wall B. A corner of a structure was found there together with the evidence of collapsed architecture and a mosaic fragment, out of its original context. The structure also had a NW-SE orientation of the earlier phase. The pottery finds (fine wares and amphorae) from both probes ranged from the early to late Roman period, but there were noticeably more finds of Hellenistic pottery this season, especially of gray, relief decorated ware. There were also numerous fragments of tegulae and mosaic tesserae. Iron slag finds indicated some iron working or a repair shop on the site. We documented finds of lamps, bronze and iron objects, beads, and one damaged late Roman coin.
This season, two students of geography from the University of St. Thomas, Renee Huset and Matthew Weishan, conducted topographic and planimetric survey of the site and of selected (accessible) areas of the island using Global Positioning System (GPS). They collected spatial data of the cultural features (settlements, graves, pathways) and natural resources (arable land, quarries) in the landscape. Upon return to St. Thomas, they produced graphically interpretable computerized records (accurate maps and 3-D site topography) with Geographical Information Systems (GIS), which will enhance any future work in the area.

            In the summer of 2009 the project continued on the small, exploratory scale in the absence of financial support. The investigations remained selective and diagnostic. The objective was to obtain the maximum relevant data from new probes and small-scale expansions of the previous excavations in order to plan future systematic research and eventual preservation and protection of the entire villa site. The 2008 excavation of the structures on the north side of Building A was expanded to the east. New structures were found in that area, which extended further eastward into the wooded terrain.  Two small probes were dug on the west side of the standing wall (wall B), with the objective to reach a floor and to relate wall B to architectural features still underground, which were indicated by the magnetometric survey in 2007. The foundation of wall B was reached on the bedrock, 0.85 m below the present land surface. A floor was not found. In the probe at the north end of wall B a corner of another structure abutting the wall was uncovered. Rich finds of chronologically diagnostic pottery fragments dated from the Hellenistic period in the 2nd century BCE to the late Roman period in the 6th c. CE.

              Significant finds were made by underwater investigations of the salt works in Soline Bay.  Jonathan Estes, a St. Thomas history major, worked on his independent research project on the sea economy of the villa. He explored and documented the submerged walls and salt pans in the bay (and some remains on the shore), which were visible on aerial photographs taken in August 2008 and on an archival photo from 1968. He and Marinko Petrić measured the lengths of the walls across the bay, but accurate measurements of the walls' width and height were impossible due to their poor preservation  and to the thick mud and sand sediment in the bay.

            The investigations conducted in the summer of 2008 comprised revision of excavation and architectural survey in three spatial segments of the villa: a standing ancient structure (named Building A), a later structure attached to Building A on its north side, and structural remains along the shore (previous Novak’s trench). Aerial survey and photography of the site was done later in the season.  Building A had three walls still preserved up to 2 meters in height, but it was completely overgrown with brush and small trees, which had to be removed before any archaeological work. The most important discovery in Building A was the original sub-floor and the in situ remains of the mosaic that once decorated the floor. The wall construction was determined to be from the late Roman period, 4th-6th century.

              Aerial photography revealed submerged remains of four walls of the former salt works in the bay.  The walls run across the bay from one shore to the other in the NW-SE direction. Although the salt works in Soline Bay have been known from a medieval document in Hvar and an aerial photo from 1968, this aerial survey provided updated evidence of their architectural layout. The likely Roman origin and relationship with the villa needed underwater exploration.
Two students from the University of St. Thomas and one from Gustavus Adolphus College participated in the project in 2008. One of the St. Thomas students, a history major, Madison Bruber, was a recipient of the St. Thomas  Young Scholar award. Her research project dealt with the Byzantine-Gothic wars in the Adriatic in the 6th century, and a possible role of the Soline villa site (harbor, food supplies) in those wars.

          <p class="lead">
            In the summer of 2007 we received a grant from the Archaeo/Community Foundation in support of exploratory surveys at the villa site: 1) geodetic survey (Croatian surveyor); 2) geophysical/magnetometric survey (Dr. David Monsees, Washington, DC); 3) architectural survey of the standing structures (Dr. Vlasta Begović). The local community of Vlaka and the Hvar Heritage Museum (whose jurisdiction the site is under) were in need of systematic survey and non-destructive, sub-surface reconnaissance in order to investigate and protect the resources located in this active agricultural and tourist area. The long-term objective of the project was to provide systematic documentation and conduct proper exploration and preservation of this significant cultural resource.

              The archaeological work supported by the grant was the first systematic survey and research of the site known since 1956, when a renowned Hvar archaeologist Grga Novak dug a trench near the standing ancient structures of unknown date. Novak uncovered small sections of Roman walls and fragments of floor mosaics, but did not publish his findings. He only briefly mentioned the site as a Roman villa in his book on the history of Hvar in 1960. An international survey of the central Dalmatian islands, including Sv. Klement, in the 1980’s and 1990’s recorded the site in the volume on Hvar Island (Gaffney, Kirigin, Petrić, Vujnović, Archaeological Heritage of the Island of Hvar, British Archaeological Reports, International Series 660, Oxford 1997, p. 208). 
              The archaeological potential was obvious to us in 2007. The historical significance of the site was anticipated in view of the Greek colonies, founded in the 4th century BCE on the neighboring islands, as well as Roman and Byzantine sites on these islands.  Indeed, our surveys and a test probe in 2007 provided the essential information toward resolving questions related to the extent, layout, chronology and historical significance of the villa site. The small but significant finds of Hellenistic and Roman Republican pottery pushed back the previously estimated date of the site. Fragments of North African and East Mediterranean Red Slip Ware, fine tableware of the 4th to 6h centuries produced around Carthage and at Phocaea (Turkey), indicated the significance of the site in the late Roman period.  Such imported ware is found only on major sites in the Adriatic, such as Emperor Diocletian’s palace at Split. Additional finds of North African and Byzantine (Aegean) amphorae of the 6th century CE confirmed the site’s importance in economy and navigation during late antiquity.
